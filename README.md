# IMCE Third-Party OWLAPI Libraries

This project builds an aggregate of the OWL API published by several organizations, including:

- [net.sourceforge.owlapi](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi) The official OWL API as the de-facto reference implementation of the [W3C OWL Functional Syntax Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/)

- [org.openrdf.sesame](http://rdf4j.org) The Eclipse RDF4J Sesame implementation of [W3C Resource Description Framework, RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)
